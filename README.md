# TRD-Net

Urbanization intensifies building energy consumption and carbon emissions, challenging
sustainable development. This study introduces the Temporal Convolutional
Network-Residual Network-Deep Reinforcement Learning (TRD-Net) model, a hybrid
approach designed to enhance urban building energy management and carbon emission
reduction. TRD-Net captures temporal-spatial features, strengthens deep feature
representation, and optimizes decision-making. The model achieved 95.1% accuracy and
a 94.81% Area Under the Curve (AUC) on the Urban Building Energy Consumption
Dataset, outperforming existing methods. These results demonstrate TRD-Netâ€™s
potential in advancing energy efficiency and sustainability in urban environments.
